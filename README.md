# What to eat

"What to eat" is an app that helps you find some food on days where you are doubting what to bring to your stomach. Consuming the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) to retrieve the food images and text, the user can sort the foods by the latest or oldest date or at a random order.
